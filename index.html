    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>I am currently finishing my Ph.D. in Technology, Policy, and Innovation in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University, where I am also pursuing Advanced Graduate Certificate in Data and Computational Science. In 2019, I have been selected to participate in the Summer Doctoral Program at the Oxford Internet Institute (OII), University of Oxford.</p>
    <p>I hold an M.Sc. in Education, Technology and Society from the University of Bristol and Sarjana (BA) in Psychology from Universitas Gadjah Mada. In 2010, I won IESLP scholarship to study English at the University of Arizona.</p>
    <p>Outside academia, I enjoy swimming, hiking, interior design, and photography.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of digital technology and human behavior. Particularly, I study heterophily (the tendency to develop diverse networks), diversity, and identity on social media. Currently, I am working on these following projects.</p>
    <p><b>Heterophily on Social Networking Sites.</b> Advised by Todd L. Pittinsky, I examine heterophily concerning race, ideology, and faith on social networking sites such as Facebook. I aim to answer, “Under what conditions are individuals willing to befriend those who are different in terms of ethnicity, political ideology, and religion?”<p>
    <p><b>Racial Identity on Social Media.</b> Working with Jason J. Jones, I study how people identify themselves as members of particular race or ethnicity on social media, especially Twitter. Even though this social identity is salient in face-to-face interaction, it is not always the case with the online world. Hence, I am intrigued to learn why some people deliberately put racial identifiers (e.g., black, Asian) on their bios while others avoid it. Does this choice have something to do with what currently happens in the real world? <p>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>Before coming back to academia, I worked as a Leadership Training and Development Associate at Nutrifood, based in Jakarta, Indonesia. During my tenure, I combined my knowledge in industrial and organizational psychology with my skills in information technology to develop various digital learning platforms, an online assessment center, and a series of leadership trainings.</p>
    <p>I have also been involved in various voluntary work and community services such as an IT support and facilitator at Worker's Educational Association (WEA) Bristol, a tutor at Kelas Inpirasi - Indonesia Mengajar in Jakarta, a mentor at Sagasitas Indonesia, and an iniator of a cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) program to reduce anxiety among inmates at Sleman Correctional Institution, Special Region of Yogyakarta.</p>
