    <h3>Education</h3>
    <p>I am currently finishing my Ph.D. in Technology, Policy, and Innovation in the College of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Stony Brook University, New York. I am also pursuing Advanced Graduate Certificate in Data and Computational Science at the same university. In summer 2019, I have been selected to participate in the Oxford Internet Institute (OII) Summer Doctoral Programme at the University of Oxford, England. </p>
    <p>I hold a M.Sc. in Education, Technology and Society from the University of Bristol, England and Sarjana (BA) in Psychology from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia. In summer 2010, I received a scholarship to study English at the University of Arizona, Arizona.</p>

    <h3>Research</h3>
    <p>My research interests lie at the intersection of digital technology and human behavior. Currenty, I am working on these following projects.</p>
    <p><i>Heterophily on Social Networking Sites.</i> I examine the tendency to develop diverse networks or known as heterophily, concerning race and political ideology on social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. I aim to answer, “What models explain and predict individual’s tendency to develop diverse networks beyond a mere chance?”<p>
    <p><i>Racial Identity on Social Media.</i> I study how people identify themselves as members of particular race or ethnicity on Twitter. Even though those construcst are salient in face-to-face interactions, it is not the case with online world. Hence, I am interested to investigate motivations and reasons associated with such identity. Why do some people deliberately put racial identity (e.g., black, Asian) on their Twitter bios while others hide it?<p>

    <h3>Experience</h3>
    <p>Before coming back to academia, I worked as a Leadership Training and Development Associate at Nutrifood, based in Jakarta, Indonesia. During my tenure, I combined my knowledge in industrial and organizational psychology with my skills in information technology to develop various digital learning platforms, an online assessment center, and a series of leadership trainings.</p>
