<p><strong>FIRMAN M FIRMANSYAH</strong></p>
<p>I am a Ph.D. candidate in Technology, Policy, and Innovation at Stony Brook University, New York. My interests lie at the intersection of digital technology and human behavior. Specifically, I study diversity, identity, and privacy on social media utilizing computational social science approach (&ldquo;big data&rdquo; + social science). I hold a M.Sc. in learning technology from University of Bristol, England and BA in psychology from Universitas Gadjah Mada, Indonesia.</p>
<p>Previously, I worked as a Leadership Training and Development Associate at Nutrifood, the market leader in healthy foods and beverages industry, based in Jakarta and volunteered at Workers' Educational Association (WEA) &ndash; Bristol, a charity providing adult education.</p>
<p><strong>Current Research</strong></p>
<p><em>Racial and Political Ideology Diversity on Social Networking Sites</em></p>
<p>Advised by Todd L. Pittinsky, I examine a tendency to develop diverse networks, concerning race and political ideology on social networking sites such as Facebook. Specifically, I aim to answer, &ldquo;What models explain and predict individual&rsquo;s tendency to develop diverse networks on social networking sites beyond mere chance?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I find this topic very important because most social networking sites users tend to &lsquo;flock&rsquo; with similar others. This tendency not only alienates the benefits of diversity (e.g., improved intergroup relations, increased innovation) but also potentially evokes the drawbacks of homogeneity. For instance, it creates filter-bubbles and echo-chambers which make the users get exposed to the same information over and over leading to narrowmindedness, even conflicts. Meanwhile, what makes them willing to diversify their networks remain underexplored.</p>
<p><em>Movies and Racial Identity on Social Media</em></p>
<p>Working with Jason J. Jones, I investigate the association between the release of racial theme movies and racial identity development on social media. I began with the Black Panther movie, which has become a phenomenon in American society. Many film critiques and experts claim that this awards-winning movie plays significant roles in the Black community. Yet, little research has been done to investigate such effects.</p>
<p>Thus, utilizing Twitter bios as a proxy to measure Black racial identity, I apply machine learnings and other statistical tests to examine the proportions of Black users having race identifier words (e.g., Black, African American) on their bios before and after the Black Panther movie release. If the movie really has an impact on the Black identity, the proportion should increase significantly after the movie release.</p>
