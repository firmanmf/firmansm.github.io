    <p>I combine mathematical, computational, and statistical approaches with social and psychological theories to study social phenomena and socio-technical systems.

    <p><span style="font-weight:500;">Friendship Diversity.</span> While racial, ethnic, and ideological differences have historically resulted in hatred, discrimination, and even wars, friendship transforms them into love. And yet, diverse friendships are rare even in places, where people are usually tolerant and open-minded like schools and universities. My research helps uncover the underlying mechanism behind this complex phenomenon and identifies unique solutions for a more inclusive society. </p> 
	<p>In my dissertation, I developed a theoretical framework and simulation software written in R, namely Framework for Intergroup Relations and Multiple Affiliations Networks (FIRMAN). It formalizes friendship development processes while taking people’s multiple social identities into account. FIRMAN asserts that friendship will develop between two people <i>if and only if</i> both can tolerate any meaningful differences dividing them into different groups (e.g., gender, race, religion, ideology) and are still available to commit a new friendship.</p> 
	<p>I used FIRMAN to elucidate why homogeneous friendships persist even in a diverse place, where the opportunity to develop diverse friendships is greater than chances<sup>[<a href="https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/zr7p3/" target="_blank">p</a>, <a href="https://www.comses.net/codebase-release/2ffcfa3a-1ff9-45fe-94cc-50fe37de59ea/" target="_blank">c</a>]</sup>. My agent-based simulations revealed that the presence of intolerant agents, though a few (< 15%), block tolerant others from befriending agents of different groups making homogenous friendships unavoidable. Here is my presentation at Networks 2021 conference:</p>

		<br>
	<p>In another simulation study, I used FIRMAN to explain how a social media platform like Facebook has maintained segregated friendship rather than bringing diverse people closer together as intended<sup>[<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.08862" target="_blank">p</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34971-4_5" target="_blank">c</a>]</sup>. I argue that Facebook has increased the number of contacts users can maintain (tie capacity) dramatically, but has done little to increase the level of diversity users can tolerate (tie outreachability). While this research focused on ethnicity, the explanation may also apply to racially and ideologically segregated friendships.</p>
	<br>

    <p><span style="font-weight:500;">Computational Social Science.</span> I like to explore publicly available digital trace data and use them to investigate social phenomena. For instance, I used Twitter bios to study Black racial identity and how it might have been affected by the Black Panther movie release <sup>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34971-4_5" target="_blank">p</a>]</sup>. In another research, I looked at donation records from popular crowdfunding platforms GoFundMe (the United States) and Kitabisa (Indonesia), to study altruistic behavior across cultures, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic<sup>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-73103-8_3" target="_blank">p</a>, <a href="https://github.com/firmansm/Covid-19-Donations" target="_blank">d</a>]</sup>. Using a massive database of Indonesian voter records, I investigated how differences in the lenght of Javanese males' and females' names reflect progress toward gender equality in the society<!--sup>[p, c, d]</sup-->. These studies have provided unique evidence to social sciences, which typically rely on self-report data from small to moderate sample sizes.</p> 
	<br>
	
    <p><span style="font-weight:500;">Human-Computer Interaction.</span> I collaborate with computer scientists and engineers to make sense of human-computer interaction and technology in society. For instance, we brought the nudge theory to a study examining how the Indonesian government’s ebook program might have affected students' preference for reading devices<sup>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/DLP-07-2020-0066" target="_blank">p</a>]</sup>. We utilized the loss aversion theory to shed more light on why some people naturally adopt two-factor authentication (2FA) technology to secure their online activities while others intentionally choose to skip it<sup>[<a href="https://doi.org/10.1108/ACI-12-2020-0156" target="_blank">p</a>]</sup>. </p>

	<!--p>During my time at Stony Brook University, I held a variety of positions. As a Research Assistant at the <a href="https://wastedata.info/" target="_blank">Waste Data & Analysis Center</a>, I sampled and analyzed New York State general and recycling waste data. As a Teaching Assistant, I assisted faculty in the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/est/" target="_blank" style="color: #035397;">Department of Technology and Society</a> with topics such as system theory, research methods, and IT applications. As a Collegiate Science and Technology Entry Program <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/stem-smart/" target="_blank">(CSTEP)</a>  instructor, I taught underrepresented minority students how to code and use various multimedia software.</p-->
    <p>I previously worked as a Leadership Training and Development Associate at <a href="https://www.nutrifood.co.id" target="_blank">Nutrifood</a> in Jakarta, Indonesia. During my tenure, I applied my knowledge of industrial and organizational psychology, as well as my IT skills, to develop a number of digital learning platforms, an online assessment center, and a series of leadership training.</p>
    <p>I have also been involved in various voluntary projects and community services such as an IT support and facilitator at Workers’ Educational Association <a href="https://www.wea.org.uk/south-west/bath-north-east-somerset-bristol-south-gloucestershire" target="_blank">(WEA)</a> Bristol, a tutor at <a href="http://kelasinspirasi.org/" target="_blank" style="color: #035397;">Kelas Inpirasi</a> - Indonesia Mengajar in Jakarta, a mentor at Sagasitas Indonesia, and the initiator of a cognitive behavioral therapy program to reduce anxiety among inmates at Sleman Correctional Institution, Special Region of Yogyakarta.</p>
	<p>As said earlier, I like traveling. Born and raised in the same town and received all of my K-12 education within a 3.1 mile (5 kilometers) radius, I wanted to see the world and learn about different cultures. Traveling makes me 'richer' and wiser in some ways. Here are the countries I have visited so far.</p>
